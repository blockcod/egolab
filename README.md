**Message:** As it currently stands, the internet is a free and secure enviornment for all to use. However, it is not entirely clear what the _future_ holds. There have been many attempts to infringe upon users' rights, whether that be through charging for bandwidth throttling and marketing for targetted advertisements. Help keep the _future_ of the internet a better place by standing up for your rights and those of the less fortunate!
